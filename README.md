# 🚫 dodging No-tkinter

> A playful Python desktop game where **saying "No" is not an option.**  
> The "No" button dodges your mouse. You can only say "Yes"... eventually.

---

## 🎮 Features

- GUI built with `tkinter`
- "No" button **jumps away** when hovered
- Only the "Yes" button is clickable
- Simple logic, pure fun
- Open to creative forks – add your own Easter eggs!

---

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the game：

```bash
python main.py
```
(If you’re fast enough… maybe you can click “No”?)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (standard library, no external dependencies)

---

## 📦 Packaging Note

You can package the game using PyInstaller:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
```
⚠ Note: .exe files built this way may trigger antivirus software warnings due to the nature of PyInstaller bundles.

## 🌐 Future Plan
- Rewriting this into a browser-based version using JavaScript
- Hosting as a public mini-game for easier access

---

## 📜 License

- MIT License – fork, remix, and enhance as you like.
- 💡 Bonus idea: Add your own impossible-to-click buttons or weird reaction logic!
